    <h2>The perfect bowl of noodles for those that love ramen but are way too lazy to make it from scratch!</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite dishes in the world is Ramen. So many possibilities and combinations of flavor. It is impossible to get bored of it. But it can be a bit of a chore to make the perfect bowl from scratch.</p>
        <p>This is my way of cheating the system and making a lazy, but still delicious, bowl of Ramen. This version is going to be spicy and flavorful with all of my favorite bits of this highly popular dish, but cooked in only a fraction of the time. </p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your favorite pack of instant noodles</li>
            <li>Flavor Packet that comes with the noodles</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>1 clove of Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of grated Ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Scallions</li>
            <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
            <li>Chili oil</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Optional</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
            <li>Hoisin Sauce</li>
            <li>Fish Sauce</li>
            <li>Tofu</li>
            <li>Your Choice of Protein (Beef, Chicken, Shrimp, etc.)</li>
            <li>Assorted Vegetables (Carrots, Mushrooms, Cabbage, Spinach, etc.)</li>
            <li>Nori</li>
            <li>Thai Basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a small sauce pot on medium heat and add the Sesame oil. Once hot add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Let it saute for 30 seconds to a minute (<strong>DO NOT LET IT BURN!</strong>). If you have any other veggies you want to saute, now is the time to do it.</li>
            <li>Once the garlic and ginger is sauteed add the soy sauce, Chili oil, and any other sauce you feel like adding. This will create the base of the broth.</li>
            <li>Now that everyone is getting along add 2 cups of water and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>With the water now boiling, add the ramen noodles and let them cook for 3 minutes or so until they are tender.</li>
            <li>Add the flavor packet that came with the Ramen if you wish. If you have your own seasoning mix then add that instead.</li>
            <li>Bring the heat down to low and add the egg. <strong>DO NOT STIR!</strong> Let it sit for 6-7 minutes until the egg whites are cooked but the yolk is still nice and runny.</li>
            <li>Pour the ramen into your bowl and proceed to garnish it with all your desired fixings. In my case I am adding sesame seeds, chopped scallions, and more chili oil. <em>I like it Spicy!!!</em></li>
            <li><strong>ENJOY!!!</strong></li>
        </ol>
