    <h2>Chicken so good you'll slap your abuela!</h2>
        <p>Everybody loves chicken, and if you don't, stop lying to yourself. This recipe is simple, quick and easy. You won't have to worry about cleaning too many dishes and it'll be ready in less than hour. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8-10 chicken drumsticks w/ skin on</li>
            <li>Ghee, due to its high smoke point (or butter)</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
            <li>Chili Powder</li>
            <li>Onion Powder</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First lets begin with preheating the oven to 425 degrees Farenheit. Cooking at this temperature will help get a nice golden brown crust on the chicken without drying out the meat.</li>
            <li>Next you will want to pat the drumsticks with a dry paper towel to get any excess moisture off of it. This will allow the chicken to crisp up nicely.</li>
            <li>Cover the now dry chicken legs with ghee (or butter). This will also help with getting a nice and crsipy outside, while also helping all the seasoning adhere to the outside of the chicken.</li>
            <li>Now mix in a small bowl a tablespoon of garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, smoked paprika, sea salt, and pepper. Also add about a teaspoon chili powder. Mix all the spices together.</li>
            <li>In a larger bowl (Or large ziploc bag) toss in the drumsticks lathered in your choice of fat. Then add the spice mix into the bowl and mix it all up. You want to make sure the drumsticks are completely covered in seasoning. Don't forget to get some seasoning under the skin of the chicken too.</li>    
            <li>Place the drumsticks evenly on a baking rack or an aluminum foiled wrapped oven tray. Bake for 35-45 mins depending on the size of the drumsticks. Turn the drumsticks half way through to get an even crust on them. You know they are done cooking when internal temp reads 165 degrees Farenheit. Let them rest for 5-10 minutes after baking.</li>
            <li><strong>ENJOY!!!</strong></li>   
        </ol>
