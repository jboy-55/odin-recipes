    <h2>The Greatest Breakfast Sandwich on the Planet!!!</h2>
        <p>This sandwich is comprised of all the things I love about breakfast. A nice, fluffy omelette with cheese oozing out the seams, bacon fried to a crisp, and finally, two perfectly toasted slices of sourdough bread to hold in all of that goodness.</p> 
        <p>It's a very simple recipe to make and extremely customizable to suit the pickiest of palates. Depending on my mood I like to change it up and add avocado, tomatoes, and if I'm really feeling it I'll even make some hashbrowns (Not today though) and throw that in there. There is no one way to make this amazing sandwich!</p> 
        <p><Strong>HAVE FUN WITH IT!!!</Strong></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2-3 slices of your favorite cheese (I like Muenster)</li>
            <li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
            <li>4-5 strips of applewood smoked bacon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Optional</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 avocado (sliced)</li>
            <li>2 tomato slices</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Your choice of Hot Sauce <em>(Kick it up a notch!)</em></li>         
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a medium-sized frying pan (Large enough to fit 4-5 slices of bacon and later on 2 large slices of sourdough bread) to medium heat. Place the bacon strips in the pan once it is nice and hot. Cook on both sides for about 2-3 mins or until it reaches your desired crunchiness. Remove bacon and set aside. Keep the bacon fat in the pan for later use.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, crack the 2 large eggs and whisk away until it is all nice and evenly blended. Add salt & pepper to desired taste.</li>
            <li>Proceed to heat up a small frying pan to medium low heat. Once hot, melt the tablespoon of butter into the pan. Pour the whisked eggs into the frying pan and let the eggs slowly cook. After about a minute or two, throw the slices of cheese on top of the forming omelette. Let it sit there for another 2-3 minutes to let the cheese melt. Once the cheese has melted and most of the eggs have cooked you can proceed to fold the omelette in half and let it cook for another minute or 2 on each side. This will really get the eggs to fluff up a bit and have the cheesing oozing everywhere. Yum!</li>
            <li>Getting back to the frying pan with the bacon fat, place your two slices of sourdough bread into the pan while hot. This will begin to toast the outside of the bread as well as get the bread to absorb some of that delicious bacon fat. Leave for about 2-3 minutes on each side until you reach your desired level of toastiness. </li>
            <li>Now that all of your sandwich contents have been made to your liking, it is now time to putit all together. Like i mentioned earlier I like to add sliced tomatoes, half of an avocado and a little mayo. If you wanted to kick it up a notch now would be the time to sprinkle some of your favorite hot sauce over the eggs or right onto the inside part of the toasted bread.</li>
            <li>Cut in half for easier (and less messy) consumption. <Strong>ENJOY!</Strong></li>
